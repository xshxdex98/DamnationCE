/*
HALO_PORT_CAPACITY.H

Memory capacity of the native builds (Windows, Linux, Android), sized for the
session limits in halo_port_limits.h, which includes this file. The Xbox
sizes are given in parentheses below.

Every machine in a session must be built with the same values: the
distributed netcode names objects and players by their datum index, the
same on every machine (port/linux/game/network_objects.c tracks
MAXIMUM_TRACKED_OBJECTS = HALO_PORT_MAXIMUM_OBJECTS_PER_MAP objects, and a
client's own objects take the upper half of the object array).

/* ---------- game state

The Xbox game state is 0x345000 bytes at 0x80061000 and ends where the tag
cache begins (0x803A6000). Cache files are linked to that tag cache address,
so the game state cannot grow in place. The native builds put a 16 MB game
state above the tag cache (which ends at 0x819A6000), inside the Xbox memory
window (0x80000000-0xA0000000, Android's to 0x88000000:
port/linux/src/platform.h) and below everything the window hands out
top-down (texture and sound caches, Direct3D resources).

The CPU part holds about 17.2 MB of pools at the sizes below (the Xbox pools
fill 3,165,260 of its 0x305000 bytes); the GPU part holds only the decal
vertices, as on the Xbox. A change to a pool's size changes the game state's
layout: saved games of builds before it no longer load. */

/* ---------- textures

The texture cache holds the textures being drawn in 16 KB pages, 22 MB of
them on the Xbox, which Xbox maps were made to fit. Halo Custom Edition maps
were made for Halo PC, which has no such bound: a frame of
beavercreek_halo3.yelo draws more than 22 MB of textures, and a texture that
does not fit is drawn as the default one ("YOU GOT STABBED" in debug.txt).
foundation@ce's Reach grenade alone is a 5.3 MB texture, which a 44 MB
cache could not place among the others, and a frame of bigass_v3 draws more
than 64 MB: the textures pushed out are drawn as the default one and loaded
again every frame (420 MB a second).

The desktop builds' cache is 256 MB, half their 512 MB memory window
(port/linux/src/platform.h). Android's window is 128 MB, and with a 44 MB
cache and beavercreek_halo3.yelo loaded 52 MB of it were free: its cache is
64 MB. */
