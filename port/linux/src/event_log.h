/*
EVENT_LOG.H

Delta Stats' event log (halo.milenko.org/delta): what happened in a
game this machine hosts, gathered on the game's thread by
port/linux/game/game_events.c, kept within fixed limits here
(event_log.c), and made into the game's batch (schema 1, JSON) at its end,
which event_upload.c compresses (event_gzip.c) and sends to the game list.

Plain types only across this boundary (int, short, float, char; no long,
which the 64-bit builds' copy of the game's sources spells int, and no
64-bit member, which -malign-double places differently): the game's side is
compiled with the Xbox's ABI, this side with the platform layer's. Names
cross as UTF-8.

One game is recorded at a time, on one thread (the game's): begin, then
players and events, then finish, which hands the encoded batch over. No
address of anyone is ever in it: players are their names and a keyed hash
of their machine's hardware ID.
