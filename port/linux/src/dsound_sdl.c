/*
DSOUND_SDL.C

Xbox DirectSound for the native builds: a software mixer on an SDL3 audio
stream.

The game plays everything through DirectSound streams: 16-bit stereo PCM
(music and other uncompressed sounds) and Xbox ADPCM, mono or stereo, at 22
or 44 kHz. A packet is decoded to 16-bit PCM when the game submits it, since
the sound cache may reuse its memory once the packet completes. The mixer
runs on SDL's audio thread; for every voice it resamples to the output rate
with a windowed sinc low pass (which is how SetFrequency changes pitch;
resampling) and applies:
	- the stream volume (millibels),
	- the front left and right mix bin volumes of 2D voices,
	- for 3D voices, DirectSound's inverse distance rolloff between the
	  minimum and maximum distance, an equal power pan from the source's
	  direction in listener space, and the I3DL2 direct path, obstruction
	  and occlusion levels, their high frequency levels a low pass at the
	  environment's HF reference: a sound behind a wall is muffled.
3D voices also send to an I3DL2 reverb of the environment the listener is in
(reverb). Doppler and cones are not modelled. A look-ahead limiter keeps the
sum under full scale (limit).

Packets the mixer has finished are completed from DirectSoundDoWork, which
the game calls every frame, and from Flush, never from the audio thread:
the game's completion callback is not meant to run concurrently with it.

Without an audio device, a clock thread runs the same mixer into a scratch
buffer, so streams still drain at their real rate.

audio.volume sets the master volume (default 1.0); audio.reverb = false
turns the reverb off; audio.enabled = false skips opening a device
(port_config.c).

kHz) and takes the images of it out (80 dB down), but for those of its last
few hundred hertz, which lie beside them, about 20 dB down. Linear
interpolation, which the mixer did before, left the images only 8 to 20 dB
down, a gritty haze above 11 kHz over every 22 kHz voice. A voice
played faster than the output rate takes its frames (a step over 1) gets the
low pass narrowed to match, up to RESAMPLER_MAXIMUM_STRETCH times, so it
does not alias. The frames come from the voice's packets in turn, so the low

/* ---------- reverb

The Xbox ran an I3DL2 reverb on its audio DSP (the effects image the game
downloads), fed by every 3D voice's I3DL2 mix bin. The game sets the listener
properties from the sound environment the camera is in (sound_dsound_xbox.c
dsound_set_listener_properties), and each 3D voice's room send from its
reverb attenuation and occlusion (dsound_channel_set_I3DL2_properties). This
is a reverb of the I3DL2 model on those properties, not the DSP's program:
	- each 3D voice sends to a mono bus at the listener's and its own room
	  levels, occlusion included, their high frequency levels a low pass at the
	  HF reference, attenuated with distance by the room rolloff factors
	  (voice_gains);
	- the early reflections are REVERB_TAPS taps of the bus, starting the
	  reflections delay later, at the reflections level;
	- the late reverberation starts the reverb delay after the reflections:
	  all-pass diffusers as strong as the diffusion, then a feedback delay
	  network of REVERB_LINES lines, as long as the density makes them, each
	  losing what decays it by 60 dB in the decay time, and its high
	  frequencies in the decay time times the HF ratio, at the reverb level.
Both are normalized to the energy sent, so their levels are relative to the
room level, as I3DL2 gives them. A change of environment crossfades each
delay's read from its old length to its new one, and each gain, over
REVERB_FADE_FRAMES: what is reverberating carries on, without the click of a
jump or the pitch shift of a sliding delay. audio.reverb = false fades the
reverb out over as long and stops it. Once nothing has been sent for
REVERB_QUIET_FRAMES and the reverberation is 120 dB down, the reverb stops
until something is sent again (outdoors, in the menus). */

The game sets its mix bins' headroom to 0 (sound_dsound_xbox.c), so the voices
sum at their full level, as on the Xbox, and a pile of loud ones goes over
full scale. Clipping each sample, or bending it near full scale, distorts the
sound: dialogue over gunfire crackled. Instead the whole mix is turned down
for as long as it would go over, both channels alike. The output is delayed
LIMITER_LOOKAHEAD - 1 frames (1.3 ms), so that the gain comes down smoothly
before each peak: the smallest gain the frames ahead need, averaged over the
last LIMITER_LOOKAHEAD frames, is never more than a peak needs when it plays.
