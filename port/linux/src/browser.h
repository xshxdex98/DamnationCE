/*
BROWSER.H

The game list (configure.py --game-browser, HALO_GAME_BROWSER): the system
link games hosted by copies of the game anywhere, listed on
network.browser_url (halo.milenko.org). A host's game is listed with its
invite (p2p.c); a player picks a listed game, which joins its invite, and
the host's game then shows in System Link as any game reached through an
invite. See browser.c.
