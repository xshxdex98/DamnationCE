/*
HUD_HIRES.H

The high-res HUD: textures drawn from the hand-made SVG redraws of the Halo PC
HUD sheets (port/assets/hud, made by tools/hud_assets.py), each 8x the size
of the bitmap of the Xbox maps it stands for (4x for the largest) and in that
bitmap's layout. The menus' titles, pictures of text in the maps, are drawn
the same way (port/assets/titles, made by tools/title_assets.py), and so are
their controller button icons (port/assets/buttons, made by
tools/button_assets.py).
tools/embed_assets.py makes them C data (hud_hires_embedded); hud_hires.c
decodes them, and the texture cache (xbox_textures.c) draws one in place of
its bitmap whenever that bitmap's pixels are uploaded: the game still sizes
and places the bitmap by its tag, so nothing else changes.
A texture may instead stand for only some of a bitmap's sprites (the
buttons among the message icons the menus set into their text): the game
draws those sprites from a placeholder bitmap of the same size
(port/linux/game/hud_hires_tags.c), which the texture cache draws the
texture for, and the bitmap's other sprites from the bitmap as before.
