/*
D3D8_GL.C

The Xbox Direct3D 8 device, implemented with OpenGL 4.5 (4.1 on macOS,
OpenGL ES 3 on Android).

The game drives the device through the XDK's inline functions, which keep
the "simple" render states in D3D__RenderState and call into this file for
everything else. At each draw the full state is read back from there and
translated: the vertex program into GLSL once per shader (nv2a_vsh.c), the
pixel shader - texture stages and register combiners, 57 render states -
into GLSL once per combination (nv2a_psh.c), and the rest into GL state.

Conventions carried over from the Xbox:
- Clip space is D3D's (depth 0..1, y down in window space). glClipControl
  (GL_UPPER_LEFT, GL_ZERO_TO_ONE) makes GL agree, so viewports, scissors and
  texture rows line up with D3D's top-left origin; the window blit at
  Present flips the image back for display.
- Render targets and textures are identified by the physical address in
  their Data field. A texture whose data is a render target samples the GL
  render target directly (render-to-texture).
- Vertex data is read from guest memory at draw time.

/* ---------- the screen's width

The Xbox screen is 640x480. The native ports can draw a wider one: 480
lines, and as many columns as the display's shape gives. On Android that is
display.screen_width (port_config.c; 640 keeps 4:3); on the desktop, the
shape of the window (of the display while the game is fullscreen, or of
display.resolution), and 640 where display.resolution_scaling is "original".
The game's camera derives its horizontal field of view from the viewport, so
the 3D view simply widens. The menus and full-screen overlays are laid out
for 640 columns; while they draw (halo_screen_ui_offset), everything shifts
right to center them.

The desktop also draws at that resolution (platform_screen_mode): render
targets the size of the screen get that many pixels (screen_scale), and
viewports, clears and visibility counts are scaled to match, so the game
still works in its 480 lines; "original" draws 640x480, scaled up at
presentation. The width and the scale change only between frames, after one
is presented (halo_screen_commit). */

Consecutive draws share most of their state, but each sets all of it: the
setters here skip the call when GL already holds the value. Code that
changes GL state behind the cache's back (clears, presentation, texture
uploads, render target and framebuffer creation) calls
xgpu_gl_state_invalidate, after which every value is set again. Unknown
values are all ones, which no real value matches (floats become NaN, which
compares unequal to everything). */
