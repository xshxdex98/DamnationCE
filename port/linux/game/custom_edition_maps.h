/*
CUSTOM_EDITION_MAPS.H

Custom Edition maps in the menus. With game.custom_edition on, the
multiplayer level list (ui_widget_event_handler_functions.c) adds the CE
multiplayer maps from the maps folder after the Xbox levels.

The menus that show a level (ui_widget_game_data_input_functions.c) refer
to it by an index into their own tags' strings and frames. Maps that the
tags don't have get "display indices" past those, and text_group.c and
ui_widget.c ask this file for their names, descriptions and pictures.

	below 0x1000   Xbox multiplayer level (the tags' own index)
	0x3000 + n     stock campaign level n (co-op)
	0x4000 + n     CE multiplayer map
	0x5000 + n     CE campaign map (co-op)
