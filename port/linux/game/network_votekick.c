/*
NETWORK_VOTEKICK.C

The players' vote to kick a player (port/linux/NETCODE.md). A player starts
one by picking another's name on the scoreboard (game_engine.c) or with the
console's "votekick <name>"; the others vote the same way. The host alone
counts, and kicks the machine of the player once enough have voted. A
vote's power is against the game's other players, so the host decides
every part of it and trusts nothing a client says but which player it
votes against:

- A vote counts only from its machine's own stream: a datagram's source
  address is all that names its machine, and anyone can send one as from
  another's.
- One vote a person. The votes and the players who may vote are counted by
  their machines' real addresses (an internet play peer's endpoint, not its
  stand-in, which the peer can make anew), and the votes again by hardware
  id: two machines of one address or one hardware id are one vote. The
  hardware id a machine tells the host joining (anyone's it likes), so it
  only ever takes votes away: the players who may vote are counted by their
  addresses alone, or a machine could copy another's id and so lower the
  votes needed.
- Time played: on this host, counted in its own ticks of game, not told
  by the client: votekick_minutes (config.toml) to start a vote, and a
  part of that to vote, so that a player who has only just joined (or a
  cheater's second machine) neither starts nor counts. Joining again starts
  over.
- More than half of the players who may vote, the player voted against
  counted among them (who never votes for it), and at least two: one team
  alone kicks nobody from the other in an even game, and two people never
  kick each other.
- One vote at a time, for VOTE_SECONDS, then a pause before the next. A
  player whose vote failed starts none for STARTER_COOLDOWN_SECONDS, and a
  player a vote failed against is not voted against again for
  TARGET_PROTECTION_SECONDS, both by address and hardware id.
- The host's own players are never voted against; the host kicks and bans
  as it likes (network_server_manager.c), and its machine votes as any
  other.
- Only the host speaks: what a client did wrong is told to it alone, at
  most once a second; the votes to everyone, only as they change.
- A machine kicked by a vote is kept out of the host's games, by address
  and hardware id, for votekick_ban_minutes.

A client hears the host's count every second (and as it changes), for the
scoreboard. A build without votes drops both messages as kinds it does not
know: its players cannot vote, and count as players who did not.
