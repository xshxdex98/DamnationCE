/*
NETWORK_COOP.C

Campaign co-op over the network (port/linux/NETCODE.md).

A network game on a campaign map, with no game engine running, is co-op.
Only the host runs the map's scripts (game.c), so everything the scripts do
that clients need to see is sent from this file:

- Presentation, every tick: whether a cinematic is playing, the letterbox,
  the camera, the screen fade, the HUD settings the scripts control (what
  is shown, the mission timer), the players' maximum vitality, and the
  cutscene skip vote. A client plays them one a tick by the host's clock, a
  couple of ticks behind the newest, so the camera keeps an even pace. It
  starts and stops its own cinematic to match, and looks through the host's
  camera meanwhile. If the host goes quiet for two seconds, the client ends
  the cinematic so its players aren't stuck.
- Events, which happen once: script sounds (dialogue, music, ambience),
  chapter titles, help and objective text, "Checkpoint" messages, screen
  shake, nav points, and custom animations on units and scenery. Each is
  sent in three ticks' messages in case one is lost, and numbered so a
  client applies each exactly once, in order. The engine calls the
  network_coop_note_ functions (network_coop.h) to queue them.
- Devices (doors, elevators, switches, lights). A device moves toward its
  device group's value (devices.c). On a client nothing sets those values
  but this file: doors a player walks up to and switches a player uses are
  decided by the host (the player's action is relayed to it). The host
  sends a group's value for three ticks when it changes, plus a few groups
  every tick in rotation, those that have moved since the map loaded more
  often. A scenario group is identified by its index, which is the same on
  every machine; a device's own group by the device.
- Named objects (scenery and devices) the scripts create or destroy.
  network_objects.c already handles units, vehicles, weapons and equipment.
  Twice a second the host sends which object names currently exist. A
  client that sees the same difference twice in a row, on the same BSP,
  creates or deletes its copy.
- State a late joiner would otherwise lack, resent every two seconds and on
  the tick a machine joins (host_resend): where scripted scenery and
  machines have moved, how objects look (permutations, scale), what the
  scripts have attached, the looping sounds playing, the full-screen
  cinematic effect and the nav points; on a join also the objective, the
  object names and every device that has moved.
- The view of a client with nobody to spectate yet: the host's view from
  behind, eased so it doesn't jerk.

The host also makes up for scripts written for one player: vitality they
set on player0 is set on every player (a10's shields), and a Pelican's
Warthog drop brings more Warthogs in a larger game.

Skipping a cutscene is a vote. Pressing the skip key during a skippable
cutscene votes (a client sends its vote to the host every tick), and the
host skips once more than half the machines have voted. The skip itself is
the campaign's: the host reverts to the state saved when the cutscene began
and the script carries on past it. Clients catch up through the object,
device and name syncs. The host keeps its clock running through the revert,
because the netcode needs it to only go forward (network_coop_skip_reverted).

Objects (scenery and devices) that aren't synced by network_objects.c are
found on a client by their scenario name, or, unnamed, by their object
index and tag, since the map placed them at the same index everywhere.
