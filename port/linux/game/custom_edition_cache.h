/*
CUSTOM_EDITION_CACHE.H

What the native builds' cache file loader (source/cache/cache_files.c and
cache_files_windows.c) does with Halo Custom Edition caches, OpenSauce ".yelo"
caches among them. By default it finds them, says what they are, and refuses
them. With the game.custom_edition setting on it loads and runs them
instead, which is experimental: their tags are laid out for Halo PC, and
custom_edition_cache.c and custom_edition_geometry.c convert what they know
to differ (docs/custom_edition_caches.md). The format itself is read by
cache_file_formats.c.
