/*
HOST_MEMORY.C

Guest address space for the Android port.

Everything the guest touches must lie below 4 GB, but an Android process
shares that range with ART, whose heap spaces use compressed 32-bit
references and so also live there. The host therefore claims only what the
guest needs, when it needs it:

- the Xbox contiguous window at 0x80000000 and the image's own range, at
  start-up (both at fixed addresses the guest was built for);
- pools of address space for the guest's other mappings (malloc arenas,
  thread stacks), reserved in free gaps below 4 GB as they fill up.

This file also implements guest memory write tracking (the interface of
port/linux/src/memory_watch.c): the renderer write-protects the pages behind
the textures it caches, and the SIGSEGV handler here records the first
write to each. Other faults are reported (with guest-relative addresses) and
passed on to the previous handler. Under ARM translation (the x86 emulator)
page faults cannot be caught, and the tracking compares page contents
instead (host_watch_hash.c).

/* ART reserves its spaces at addresses chosen at zygote start, and on some
devices one of them covers the fixed Xbox memory window. ART's heap
(dalvik.vm.heapsize) decides how much of the low 4 GB its spaces take: on
handhelds with a large heap (the Retroid Pocket Flip2, the AYN Thor) the
free-list large object space usually lands right above the boot image, over
0x80000000.

That space commits pages lazily from its bottom, and the game's process
(HaloActivity runs in a process of its own, ":game", and reserves the
window from JNI_OnLoad before its Java side has done anything:
host_memory_reserve_early) hardly allocates large objects, so the slice
over the window is normally idle address space: unmap exactly the
intersection (never more) and let the caller retry. Only that space, and
only a slice with no page in use (present or swapped out): ART's other
spaces (its heap, bitmaps and card tables) are live, and unmapping them
would corrupt it where failing to start is at least clear. */
