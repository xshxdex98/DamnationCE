ChupathingyCE is a community build of **OpenCE**, the port of the Halo: Combat
Evolved decompilation to modern computers and phones. Our goal is a unified
online experience, plus our own tweaks, on a project that's still in its
infancy. We follow OpenCE closely, send our fixes back to it, and put out our
own releases. Expect rough edges, and please report them.

## Features

**Online**
- **Online Games**, a server list in the Multiplayer menu: join a game with **A**, or host one with **Y**
- Games you host are listed for everyone, from any of our builds
- Invite links (`halo://join/…`) to send to friends; opening one joins their game
- Direct connections between players, with no port forwarding in most homes
- Plays with OpenCE builds of the same network version, both ways
- Dedicated servers anyone can run: a playlist of games, around the clock, with no window or player

**Stats, on [halo.milenko.org](https://halo.milenko.org)**
- A carnage report for every finished game, with medals
- Service records and leaderboards, with confirmed players (your games count toward you, whatever name you use)
- Accounts, made on the site or from the game, with an encrypted backup of your player identity
- Listing a game hosted from an OpenCE build, by its invite link

**The game**
- The campaign, split screen and System Link, running natively (no emulator)
- High-res HUD and text, and widescreen menus
- Controller prompts for Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo pads, and the keyboard
- Updates itself: it checks for new releases when it starts, and asks first

## Download

Get the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ChupathingyCE/chupathingyce/releases/latest):

| Platform | Download | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | `chupathingyce-windows-release.zip` | Windows 10 or later. |
| Linux | `chupathingyce-linux-release.zip` | Needs SDL3 (32-bit). See [port/linux/README.md](port/linux/README.md). |
| Android | `chupathingyce-android-release.zip` | Android 9 or later, 64-bit. See [port/android/README.md](port/android/README.md). |
| Mac | `chupathingyce-macos-release.zip` | macOS 13 or later, Apple silicon or Intel. |

The game checks for new releases when it starts and asks before updating.

We don't pay for code signing yet, so the first start needs one extra step:

- **Windows** may warn about an unknown publisher: choose **More info → Run anyway**.
- **Mac**: move ChupathingyCE to Applications and open it. If macOS won't open
  it, go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, and choose **Open
  Anyway** next to ChupathingyCE. You only do this once.

## You need your own copy of Halo

ChupathingyCE doesn't include the game's maps, sounds or art. You need an Xbox
disc image (`.iso` or `.xiso`) of Halo: Combat Evolved. Any region works.

1. Start ChupathingyCE.
2. The first time, it asks for your disc image. Pick it.
3. It copies the game's `maps` folder out of the image (about 2 GB), then starts.

On Android, copy the disc image to your phone first. On a Mac, the maps,
settings and saves go in `~/Library/Application Support/ChupathingyCE`.

## Playing online

| You want to | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| Join a game | **Multiplayer → Online Games**, pick a game, press **A**. Or press **Join** on [halo.milenko.org](https://halo.milenko.org). |
| Host a game | **Multiplayer → Online Games → Y (Create Game)**, or host from System Link as usual. Your game is listed online by itself. |
| Invite a friend | When you host, the game copies an invite link (`halo://join/…`). Send it; opening it joins your game. |
| See your stats | Your service record is on [halo.milenko.org](https://halo.milenko.org), found by your name. |
| Make an account | On [halo.milenko.org/profile](https://halo.milenko.org/profile), or press **Start** in Online Games to make one for the player you already are. |
| List a game from an OpenCE build | Sign in on the site, open **Host a Game**, and paste your invite link. |

Everything here plays with OpenCE builds of the same network version: they can
join your games and you can join theirs. Stats and the server list need a
ChupathingyCE host. Games hosted from OpenCE builds can still be listed by
their host on the site (Host a Game).

## Run a server

A dedicated server is a copy of the game with no player and no window, hosting
a playlist of games and listing them on halo.milenko.org and in Online Games.
You can run one on your own computer, with no port forwarding:
[the setup guide](docs/dedicated-server.md) walks through it. For one that runs
around the clock on a Linux server, see [server/README.md](server/README.md).

## How ChupathingyCE relates to OpenCE

- OpenCE ([cybersecurity/halo-ce-universal](https://github.com/cybersecurity/halo-ce-universal))
  is where the port is made. ChupathingyCE merges its changes regularly.
- We keep the same network version, so players of both play together. The line
  at the top of this page says which OpenCE builds match this one.
- Fixes to the shared game code go back to OpenCE as pull requests.
- ChupathingyCE has its own version numbers (this is v0.5.0b) and its own
  releases, so it doesn't change under you every few hours.

## Building it yourself

You need Python 3, [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) and clang. The game
supplies the Xbox SDK declarations it uses, so you don't need the SDK.

```sh
python3 configure.py
ninja            # the game for the computer you're on
```

| Target | Result | Instructions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ninja macos` | `build/macos/ChupathingyCE.app` | [port/macos/README.md](port/macos/README.md) |
| `ninja linux` | `build/linux/halo` | [port/linux/README.md](port/linux/README.md) |
| `ninja windows` | `build/windows/halo.exe` | [port/windows/README.md](port/windows/README.md) |
| `ninja android_apk` | the Android app | [port/android/README.md](port/android/README.md) |

Useful `configure.py` options:

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `--release` | A release build, as players get. Without it, a failed check stops the game. |
| `--portable` | A Linux or Windows build that runs on any x86-64 computer, to give to others. |
| `--no-game-browser` | Leaves out the server list, stats and dedicated servers, as OpenCE's builds are. |
| `--pgo=off`, `--lto=off` | Faster builds, without profile-guided or link-time optimisation. |

The version being made is in `VERSION`. Releases are built and published by
the project's release workflow; the builds on this repository's Actions page
are for checking changes.
