"""DamnationCE's version, for the builds (tools/linux_build.py,
windows_build.py, macos_build.py; port/android/app/build.gradle reads the
same):

  - VERSION, in the repository's root, is the version being made: 0.5.0b.
  - A release is built by GitHub Actions from its tag, v<VERSION>
    (tools/ci_build.py gives HALO_VERSION, and HALO_RELEASE_BUILD=1, the
    only builds whose self-updater looks for newer releases).
  - Other builds of the workflow are nightlies, <VERSION>-nightly.<run>; a
    build anywhere else is <VERSION>-dev.
