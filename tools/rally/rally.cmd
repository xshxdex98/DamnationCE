rem Halo CE Universal rally: fills your system link game with bots that run
rem to where you stand. For a PC where HaloLauncher.exe installed the game
rem (built from github.com/cybersecurity/halo-ce-universal or this fork).
rem
rem   rally.cmd [bots]   1 to 127 bots; 127, a game of 128, if left out
rem
rem It downloads its two helpers from this repository next to itself, adds
rem the position dump the bots steer by to the installed game's source
rem (rally_patch.py) and rebuilds the game when that is new, then starts
rem Halo. Create a system link game, press a key here, and the bots join.
rem Run it again while that Halo is running for another round of bots.
