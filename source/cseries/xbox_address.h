/*
XBOX_ADDRESS.H

Pointers inside Xbox data, for the 64-bit builds (HALO_64BIT).

The game's data formats embed 32-bit pointers: cache files hold tag data
whose blocks, references and data point at each other by address, game
state is saved and restored as raw memory, and Direct3D resources carry
physical addresses. A 64-bit build keeps all of that memory inside one
4 GB region reserved at a fixed host address, so that Xbox address X is host
address XBOX_ADDRESS_SPACE_BASE + X (port/linux/src/xbox_memory.c).
Structures laid out like the Xbox's declare their pointer fields XPTR(type)
(a 32-bit Xbox address) and convert with XBOX_POINTER and XBOX_ADDRESS.

Everywhere else (the Xbox, the matching MSVC build and the 32-bit ports) a
pointer is an Xbox address: XPTR(type) is `type *` and the conversions do
nothing, so the code compiles as before.
